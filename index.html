                <h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
                <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to
                    developer a
                    skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
                <p>I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching
                    young
                    minds about how to <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
                    opportunities.</p>

                <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
                </p>
                <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
                <p>"How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the
                    hardesst parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
                    something
                    you're <i>passionate</i> about.</p>
